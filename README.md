# Tritetris
<p>A game that extends from Tetris.</p>
<p>Tritetris provides you a triangle to hold the blocks. You can rotate the triangle to choose the best side you think to receive the falling block every time. It's very interesting and you need to use some strategies to get a score as
high as possible.</p>
<p>It's an HTML game. <a href="https://enzeberg.github.io/tritetris">Play it here!</a></p>

## How to play
<h4>[for Desktop] </h4>
<p>Use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move and deform the block, and key <strong>"A" and "D"</strong> to rotate the triangle.</p>
<h4>[for Mobile]</h4>
<p>Use the <strong>center gray area</strong> to move and deform the block, and the <strong>buttons</strong> to rotate the triangle.</p>

## Note
<ul>
	<li>When the falling tetromino is totally under the minddle thin line, you can't rotate the triangle.</li>
	<li>When the falling tetromino hits the squares fixed on the triangle after rotating, the tetromino goes up to avoid covering the still squares.</li>
</ul>

## Reminder
<p>The more rows of squares you remove one time, the higher score you get!</p>
