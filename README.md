#Tritetris
<p>A game that extends from Tetris.</p>
<p>Tritetris provides you a triangle to hold the blocks. You can rotate the triangle to choose the best side you think to receive the falling block every time. It's very interesting and you need to use some strategies to get a score as
high as possible.</p>
<p>It's an HTML game. <a href="https://enzeberg.github.io/tritetris">Play it here!</a></p>
